The first lines of code I ever wrote, providing quick and easy setup for the Cosmic Encounter DLC for Tabletop Simulator on Steam.

Written with LUA and uploaded to my Steam Workshop page [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2182202444).

The code isn't pretty and I've come a long way since, but I feel like it should be remembered. This was the start of everything...
